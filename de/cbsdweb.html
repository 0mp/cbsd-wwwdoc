		<p>WEB interface project for <strong>CBSD</strong> called <strong>ClonOS</strong> and implemented as a separate FreeBSD distribution<p>
		<p>Site of the project: <a href="https://clonos.tekroutine.com" target="_blank">clonos.tekroutine.com</a></p>
		<p>Also, when we obtain a certain number of comments about the ClonOS from users, it will be published in the FreeBSD ports</p>
		<p>At present it is not production-ready product, however, the part of functional is stable, e.g.:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>WEB interface to create and manage jail</li>
			<li>WEB interface for bhyve</li>
			<li>WEB interface for CBSD forms (helpers)</li>
			<li>WEB interface to work with FreeBSD sources and bases</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The developers are very interested in testing and feedback</p>
