	<p>The implementation of this feature in <strong>bhyve</strong> is grateful to the Politehnica University of Bucharest and in particular: Elena Mihailescu and Mihai Caraba»ô</p>
	<p>At the time this page was published, this functionality was not available in the FreeBSD codebase and was obtained from the project page on <a href="https://github.com/FreeBSD-UPB">GitHub (FreeBSD-UPB)</a></p>
	<p>This functional is a continuation of the <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/<!--#echo var="version" -->/wf_bcheckpoint_ssi.html">checkpoints</a> functional</p>
	<p>At the moment, the necessary condition is the presence of DFS, which in the case of <strong>CBSD</strong> should not be a problem ( more: <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/articles/cbsd_with_dfs.html">lack of binding to ZFS</a>). At the moment, the work tested on <strong>NFSv3,v4</strong> and <strong>GlusterFS</strong> ( <strong>Ceph</strong> in the testing process )</p>

	<p>WIP...</p>
