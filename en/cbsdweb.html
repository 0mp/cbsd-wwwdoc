	<h2><a name="knowit">Web based interface</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
    <p><strong>CBSD</strong> offers a web based interface called <strong>ClonOS</strong>.
      <strong>ClonOS</strong> is developed independently to be a standalone 
      platform to manage and create virtual environments in FreeBSD. <strong>ClonOS</strong> 
      itself is also FreeBSD based, and can be installed and run as a purpose 
      built FreeBSD distribution.
    </p>
    <p>More information can be found on the <strong>ClonOS</strong> website: 
      <a href="https://clonos.tekroutine.com" target="_blank">clonos.tekroutine.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>Once enough positive feedback about <strong>ClonOS</strong> is received, 
      and the developers feel it stable enough, it will be available via the 
      FreeBSD ports tree.
    </p>
    <p>While <strong>ClonOS</strong> is not currently considered to be production
      ready, the following features are functionally stable;
    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Interface to create and manage jails</li>
			<li>Interface for manage bhyve</li>
			<li>Interface to CBSD forms (Helpers to assist with common tasks)</li>
			<li>Interface to work with/configure FreeBSD sources and bases</li>
		</ul>
    <p>The developers are very interested in feedback by those using <strong>ClonOS</strong>. 
      The more testing, and feedback provided, the quicker <strong>ClonOS</strong>
      will make it into the ports tree. Please click <a href="https://www.bsdstore.ru/en/feedback.html" target="_blank">here</a>
