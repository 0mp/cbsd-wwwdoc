	<h1><span>CBSD FreeBSD jail with VIMAGE (vnet)</span></h1>
	<div class="block">
		<p>In view of some of the subtleties with FreeBSD vnet-jail, information about it warranted this separate article. First of all, the <strong>VIMAGE</strong> functionality requires a customized kernel with</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			options VIMAGE
		</pre>
		<p>If you get a kernel from the repository through a command <strong>cbsd</strong>:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% cbsd repo action=get sources=kernel
		</pre>
		<p>then your kernel has support for VIMAGE.</p>
		<p>If your kernel does not have the <strong>VIMAGE</strong> option built in, the parameter <strong>vnet</strong> 
		in the file <em>${workdir}/nc.inventory</em> will always be set to <strong>0</strong>.
		If this option is present in the kernel, in the jail creation dialog the parameter will default to <strong>vnet</strong>.</p>
		<p><strong>vnet</strong>-featured jail has at its disposal a fully virtualized and isolated network stack, which in turn allows 
		the use of a private jail (albeit virtual) interface, "right" <strong>loopback</strong>, use 
		within the jail a packet filters (<strong>pf, ipfw, pfilter</strong>), 
		raise the tunnels and reconfigure the routing table.</p>
		<p>When you create a vnet-jails the <strong>ip4_addr</strong> should indicate <strong>0</strong>, 
		which prohibit <strong>CBSD</strong> set itself an IP address for vnet jail.</p>
		
		<p><em>Note: The installation of IP addresses in the vnet jail is not implemented yet</em>
		
		<p>Also, if you want to get a jail itself an IP address automatically (via DHCP), you would write a separate section 
		devfs.rules, in which you need to open 
		<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bpf&amp;sektion=4" target="_blank"><strong>bpf(4)</strong></a>-device ( unhide bpf*).
		<p>For example, append in the file <em>/etc/devfs.rules</em>:
<pre class="cli">
[devfsrules_jail=4]
add include $devfsrules_hide_all
add include $devfsrules_unhide_basic
add include $devfsrules_unhide_login
add path zfs unhide
add path 'bpf*' unhide
</pre>
		and set this devfs rule number (4) to <strong>vnet</strong>-jail (via <strong>cbsd jconfig jname=XXXX</strong>)</p>
		<p>Also, if you completely trust the container and the applications that are running in it (those it's yours), you can use devfs rules in the container settings specify any non-existent rule number,
		for example '99'. Or, select the profile type 'trusted' when creating the container through cbsd jconstruct-tui. In such cases, inside the container will be all devices devfs </p>
		<p>CBSD creates virtual interfaces using a pair of 
		<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=epair&amp;sektion=4" target="_blank"><strong>epair(4)</strong></a>, 
		but the "other end" virtual cable that connects to the jail, <strong>CBSD</strong> renamed to <strong>eth0</strong> interface.</p>
		<p><em>Note: </em>: Rename this is relevant only for FreeBSD jails. If a jail is run as Linux-based, renaming will not happen.</p>
		<p>Renaming to <strong>eth0</strong> by the fact that each new <strong>epair</strong> increments the number of the interface, 
		those of the first <strong>vnet</strong>-jail in original, interface will be called as epair<strong>0</strong>a. 
		When you running the fifth of jails, in last jail interface will be called as epair<strong>5</strong>a. 
		It's not very convenient whith jail migrating (on another server, it may be a different number), 
		and definitely not convenient that every time you have to correct the contents of the rc.conf with the network setup.</p>
