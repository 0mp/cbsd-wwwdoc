<h1><span>Example of using <strong>CBSD</strong>/jail and Consul</span></h1>
<div class = "block">
<p>In <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/articles/cbsd_vm_hook_dhcpd.html">previous article</a> we talked about pre/post/stop/start hooks in <strong>CBSD</strong> and
how thay can help with the integration of <strong>CBSD</strong> with third-party services.
In the DHCPD integration example, we saw how to export and use the internal <strong>CBSD</strong> variables, to configuring DHCPD on-the-fly 
so that the service issues virtual addresses to the addresses we provide, which provides control over network settings in virtual environments
<a href="http://man.freebsd.org/bhyve/1" target="_blank">bhyve(8)</a>
</p>
<p>
Let's now come up with a solution that demonstrates yet another effective use of hook functionality, but also applicable to containers.
One of the frequent tasks of the modern DevOPS engineer's is to divide tasks into separate isolated environments and orchestrate them.
At the same time, all operations for delegation, modification and deletion of records should take place preferably automatically, without the participation of an engineer.
For these tasks, there is a large number of so-called 'service discovery' application, some kind of directory services that dynamically
change/have information about the infrastructure, for example:
<a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank">ZooKeeper</a>, <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/" target="_blank">etcd</a>, 
<a href="https://www.consul.io/" target="_blank">Consul</a> and many other.
In this example, we'll look at integrating with <strong>Consul</strong> for registering services and query them through HTTP API or DNS.
In addition, Consul can act as a distributed store of keys/values, the use of which we will consider in the next article.
</p>
<H1><span>Introduction</span></h1>
<p>
We can create virtual environments - by hands, via j/bconstruct-tui and entering initial parameters,
or through the cloning of previously configured environments, either using the .jconf script, or using orchestration systems such as <strong>Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Saltstack</strong> and so on.
</p>
<p>
We can manage the assignment of fixed addresses, or we can not even think about it and use DHCP.
Our main task is to force services to interact with each other and at the same time to refrain from tasks on prescribing and writing out IP addresses of services.
On the one hand, this eliminates the interlayer in the form of service discovery and related processes.
On the other hand, with this approach, you give up one of the main advantages of using containers - their mobility and portability. 
containers and virtual environments must do only one thing (and do it well), which results in a very, very large farm that is difficult to manage.
In addition, there should always be duplicate containers, and you must mean the worst option with denial of service,
when your server can suddenly fail and so the traffic should be distributed to the remaining live nodes.
</p>

<H1><span>Preparation</span></h1>

<p> In order to closely model the production environment consisting of several hosts,
we will create two bhyve virtual machines with FreeBSD/<strong>CBSD</strong> that will run the jail,
And we run Consul in the container on our physical server. In my example, all this will happen on one server in <a href="https://hetzner.de/">Hetzner</a> with one external IP address.
For us, this restriction will not play a role, since we will launch the container on a private subnet.
</p>

<p>
Run <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/<!--#echo var="version"-->/wf_bcreate_ssi.html">cbsd bconstruct-tui</a> and create the first virtual machine with the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<Li> - name: clu1 </li>
<Li> - 10GB disk </li>
<Li> - 4GB of RAM </li>
<Li> - Let's get IP address by DHCP (if you follow <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/articles/cbsd_vm_hook_dhcpd.html">CBSD/bhyve and DHCPD</a></Li>
</ul>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/img/cbsd_consul1.png" alt = "" /></p>

<p>
After the regular installation of the OS, we'll go into it, install <strong>CBSD</strong> and configure it.
</p>

<p> In the author's example, the virtual server IP is: 192.168.0.5. We login to it via VNC or ssh: </p>

<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  root@clu1: ~ # pkg update
  root@clu1: ~ # pkg install cbsd
  root@clu1: ~ # env workdir = /usr/jails/usr/local/cbsd/sudoexec/initenv
</pre>

<p> We go through the initialization stage of CBSD: </p>

</pre>
<hr>
<p> While we are here, we will also get the base files via the command: cbsd repo </p>
<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  cbsd repo action=get sources=base
</pre>
<p> Also, we need the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> utility, which we'll use to interact with <strong>Consul</strong>, so we'll put it: </p>
</p>
<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
Clu1% pkg install ftp/curl
</pre>
<p>
We'll send the virtual shutdown to reset all parameters with:
</p>
<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  shutdown -p now
</pre>
<p>
Now, in order not to go through the installation procedure twice, we'll clone the virtual machine through cbsd.
In this case, if you use <strong>CBSD</strong> on ZFS, we will benefit from ZFS and copy-on-write,
Due to which we get a cloned instance instantly and it does not eat up 6 GB of space
Its volume will increase only during the write operation.
</p>
<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  cbsd bclone old=clu1 new=clu2
</pre>
<p>
We will manually set IP to avoid entering with VNC and determine which IP was given to the server (provided that you have DHCPD running)
</p>
<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  cbsd bset jname=clu2 ip4_addr=192.168.0.6
</pre>
<p> Since cloning copies settings including the MAC address, we need to reset it so that <strong>CBSD</strong> issues any other address. </p>
<p> You can do this through: </p>
<p>
  cbsd bconfig -> Network config -> nic1 -> nic_hwaddr
</p>
<p> and set value to '0' </p>
<p> Either directly to the database: </p>
<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  % sqlite3 ~cbsd/jails-system/clu2/local.sqlite "UPDATE bhyvenic SET nic_hwaddr = '0';"
</pre>

<p> Run both virtual devices: </p>

<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  cbsd bstart clu1 clu2
</pre>
<p></p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
  % sysrc hostname="clu2.my.domain"
  % cbsd initenv-tui
</pre>
<p> Change <strong>nodename</strong> to <strong>clu2.my.domain </strong> and change the <strong>natip</strong> to <strong>192.168.0.6</strong>
Then we will send the server to reboot for completeness of verification. </p>
<p> Now it's time for <strong>Consul</strong>
<p>create a jail on our host through <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/<!--# echo var = "version"-->/wf_jcreate_ssi.html">cbsd jconstruct-tui</a> and install consul: </p>
<pre class = "brush: bash; ruler: rule;">
  cbsd jconstruct-tui
</pre>
<p> To install the software in the jail creation phase, select the pkglist menu </p>
<P class = "text-center"> <img src = "/img/cbsd_consul2.png" alt = "" /> </p>
<p> and in MANUAL enter the package name by hands: </p>
<P class = "text-center"> <img src = "/img/cbsd_consul3.png" alt = "" /> </p>

<p> We return to the main menu and select jname. Let the container name is <strong>consul</strong>:</p>
<p>The rest of the parameters suit us, so choose "create jail" and wait for the end of the initialization</p>

<p>Lanuch the jail:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
  % cbsd jstart consul
</pre>
<p>Login into jail:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
  % cbsd jlogin consul
</pre>
<p>Enable consul start on boot:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
  % sysrc consul_enable=YES
</pre>
<p>Create directory for configuration:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
  % mkdir /usr/local/etc/consul.d
</pre>
<p>and write config file <i>/usr/local/etc/consul.d/config.json</i>:</p>
<pre class="cli">
  {"acl_datacenter":"dc1","acl_default_policy":"deny","acl_down_policy":"deny","acl_master_token":"secret",
  "bootstrap_expect":1,"client_addr":"0.0.0.0","data_dir":"/var/tmp/consul","datacenter":"dc1","
  log_level":"INFO","node_name":"consul.my.domain","server":true,"ui_dir":"/var/tmp/consul/ui"}
</pre>
<p>
Then run:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
  % service consul start
</pre>
<p> On this, the Consul configuration is almost ready.
In a normal installation, the Consul cluster needs to run at least three nodes. A good option is when each hoster also runs the Consul agent on itself,
but for this demonstration we confine ourselves to a dangerous installation with one single copy of consul.
</p>

<p> We can assign a Consul IP address to the jail from the same subnet as the virtual machines.
However, we can forward ports from our only external IP inside the container and work with the Consul via external address,
especially since I plan to query him from my home PC via the Internet.
</p>
<p>
To do this, we will use the port forwarding functionality via <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang"-->/<!--#echo var="version"-->/wf_expose_ssi.html">cbsd expose</a>,
which generates rules for <strong>ipfw</strong> or <strong>pf</strong> (depending on which NAT framework you choose)
We need to throw several ports of different protocols. We will be configured with default service ports except one - we want to use <strong>Consul</strong> also as a <strong>DNS</strong> server.
By default, <strong>Consul</strong> serves DNS requests on the <i>8600</i> port, while the standard port is <i>53</i>.
Therefore, by making an expose for all ports, we can only specify the <strong>in=</strong> port - then <strong>out=</strong> will be automatically assigned the same value.
But when we forward <i>8600</i>, <strong>in=</strong> we will have <i>53</i>, because requests from the Internet to NS servers come to <i>53</i> port,
and <strong>out=</strong> respectively, will go to the <i>8600</i> port in the Consul jail.
By default, expose means working with <strong>proto=tcp</strong>, so for <i>udp</i> we need to specify the protocol explicitly. So, our commands:
</p>
<pre class="cli">
cbsd expose jname=consul in=8300 mode=add
cbsd expose jname=consul in=8301 mode=add
cbsd expose jname=consul in=8301 proto=udp mode=add
cbsd expose jname=consul in=8302 mode=add
cbsd expose jname=consul in=8302 proto=udp mode=add
cbsd expose jname=consul in=8400 mode=add
cbsd expose jname=consul in=8500 mode=add
cbsd expose jname=consul in=53 out=8600 mode=add
</pre>

<p> <strong>CBSD</strong> store the rules and applies them or deletes them when the container is started or stopped. We can verify this - in my case, the framework for NAT is <strong>pf</strong>, so by running pf we can see: </p>

<pre class="cli">
% pfctl -s nat
nat on em0 inet from 10.0.0.0/8 to ! 10.0.0.0/8 -> 138.201.18.134
nat on em0 inet from 172.16.0.0/12 to ! 172.16.0.0/12 -> 138.201.18.134
nat on em0 inet from 192.168.0.0/16 to ! 192.168.0.0/16 -> 138.201.18.134
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8140 -> 10.0.0.29 port 8140
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = telnet -> 10.0.0.9 port 23
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = ldap -> 10.0.0.2 port 389
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8300 -> 10.0.0.11 port 8300
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8301 -> 10.0.0.11 port 8301
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8301 -> 10.0.0.11 port 8301
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8302 -> 10.0.0.11 port 8302
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8302 -> 10.0.0.11 port 8302
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8400 -> 10.0.0.11 port 8400
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = 8500 -> 10.0.0.11 port 8500
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to 138.201.18.134 port = domain -> 10.0.0.11 port 8600
</pre>

<p> In the case of <strong>ipfw</strong>, similar rules would be present in the command line ipfw list
Now, we can go to our external IP address on the port <strong>:8500</strong> where the standard <strong>Consul</strong> UI lives and make sure that the service is ready
</p>
<p class="text-center"><img src="/img/cbsd_consul5.png" width="800" height="600" alt = ""/></p>
<p>
So let's sum up what we did before this stage. We have two different bhyve VMs on which <strong>CBSD</strong> is installed and ready to create and run the jail. 
We have a separate Consul container available for interaction over the Internet.
Now we come very close to integrating <strong>CBSD</strong> and <strong>Consul</strong>.
</p>

<H1><span>Configuring CBSD post/pre/hooks and Consul</span></h1>
<p>
According to the documentation for <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http/catalog.html">https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http/catalog.html</a>,
we can use various <i>Endpoint</i> to work with Consul via HTTP API. Now we are interested in registration and registration of services.
In order to limit the visibility of the data in the Consul, we will use the secret token 'secret' given by us during the <strong>Consul</strong> configuration procedure.
To use this, all requests must contain <strong>?&token=secret</strong>
</p>
<p>From <strong>CBSD</strong>, it will be useful for us to know the <strong>ip4_addr</strong> (container address) and container name <strong>$jname</strong> or <strong>$host_name</strong>
<p>
Now create two test jail, one on the <strong>clu1</strong> node with the jail name <strong>redis1</strong>, the second on <strong>clu2</strong> with jname <strong>www1</strong>:
<p>
<strong> clu1 # </strong><i>cbsd jconstruct-tui</i> -> jname: (set to redis1) -> Proceed
</p>
<p>
<strong> clu2 # </strong><i>cbsd jconstruct-tui</i> -> jname: (set to www1) -> Proceed
</p>
<p> and write a script for registration and an extract from <strong>Consul</strong>: </p>

<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
#!/bin/sh
hostname=$( hostname )

/usr/local/bin/curl -X PUT "http://samson.bsdstore.ru:8500/v1/catalog/deregister?token=secret" \
-d "{\"Datacenter\": \"dc1\", \"Node\": \"$host_hostname\", \"Address\": \"$ip4_addr\", \"Service\": {\"Service\": \"jail\", \"Tags\":[ \"$hostname\", \"jail\" ] }}"

err=$?

if [ ${err} -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "reg_consul failed"
fi

exit 0
</pre>
<p>
For unregister procedure script the same, only endpoint is different:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
#!/bin/sh
hostname=$( hostname )

/usr/local/bin/curl -X PUT "http://samson.bsdstore.ru:8500/v1/catalog/deregister?token=secret" \
-d "{\"Datacenter\": \"dc1\", \"Node\": \"$host_hostname\", \"Address\": \"$ip4_addr\", \"Service\": {\"Service\": \"jail\", \"Tags\":[ \"$hostname\", \"jail\" ] }}"

err=$?

if [ ${err} -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "reg_consul failed"
fi

exit 0
</pre>

<p>make scripts executable and place into directory:</p>
<ul>
	<li>first script - into <i>/usr/jails/jails-system/redis1/master_poststart.d</i></li>
	<li>second script - into <i>/usr/jails/jails-system/redis1/master_prestop.d</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The same thing we do on <strong>clu2</strong> for the www1 jail and make sure that the behavior is similar:</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/img/cbsd_consul7.png" width="800" height="600" alt="" /></p>
<p>
Also, you can query the state through HTTP requests:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
% curl "http://samson.bsdstore.ru:8500/v1/catalog/services?token=secret"
{"consul":[],"jail":["clu1.my.domain","jail","clu2.my.domain"]}
</pre>

<p>curl "http://samson.bsdstore.ru:8500/v1/catalog/nodes?token=secret&pretty"</p>
<pre class="cli">
 [
    {
        "ID": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "Node": "consul.my.domain",
        "Address": "10.0.0.11",
        "TaggedAddresses": {
            "lan": "10.0.0.11",
            "wan": "10.0.0.11"
        },
        "Meta": {},
        "CreateIndex": 6,
        "ModifyIndex": 89
    },
    {
        "ID": "",
        "Node": "redis1.my.domain",
        "Address": "10.0.0.1/16",
        "TaggedAddresses": null,
        "Meta": null,
        "CreateIndex": 347,
        "ModifyIndex": 347
    },
    {
        "ID": "",
        "Node": "www1.my.domain",
        "Address": "10.0.0.2/16",
        "TaggedAddresses": null,
        "Meta": null,
        "CreateIndex": 378,
        "ModifyIndex": 378
    }
 ]
</pre>
<p>Now, try using <strong>Consul</strong> as DNS and query our services.
For convenience, in containers that work with <strong>Consul</strong> resources, you can add <i>.consul</i> in <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>:
<pre class="cli">
search consul
</pre>
<p>
Thus, you can handle open-records directly:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
 consul: # ping -c2 redis1
 PING redis1 (10.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.032 ms
</pre>
  
<p>Also, you can query the service with a division by data centers:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:rule;">
% dig @samson.bsdstore.ru redis1.my.domain.node.consul. ANY |grep ^redis
redis1.my.domain.node.consul. 0 IN      CNAME   10.0.0.1/16.

% dig @samson.bsdstore.ru redis1.my.domain.node.dc1.consul. ANY
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the setting is not the most difficult, and the integration possibilities are limited only by your imagination.</p>

<h1><span>Conclusions</span></h1>

<p>
In this article, we looked at approach that allows our containers to register in service discovery solution, 
without the need to manage it by hands for communicate with each other through configuration files.
Beyond this review, there are questions of health-check and service discovery of application inside jail.
</p>
<p>
Since the <i>Infrastucture-as-code</i> approach prevails in the DevOPS environment and the  <strong>CBSD</strong> authors welcome it,
an example of service discovery for services-in-jail will be discussed in a separate article about the <strong>CBSD</strong> and <strong>Puppet</strong>.
<p>
As for health check, at the moment, <strong>jail</strong> in <strong>FreeBSD</strong> is not a separated process,
which could be monitored by referring to a specific port or daemon. 
However, each container has an IP, and you can always declare healh-check rule
</p>
<pre class = "cli">
"Checks": [{"script": "ping -c2 $ ip4_addr", "interval": "10s"}]
</pre>
<p> when the service is registered. Thus, to monitor the operation of the container itself, this may well be enough.</p>
<p>
Also, you can run multiple containers of the same service at the same time, while in Consul they will register under the same name,
but have an array of IP addresses, which automatically balances the load between them.
The availability of quering via DNS allows you to deploy and run really complex configurations in transparent way, 
without requiring clients to have support with <strong>Consul</strong> integration.
